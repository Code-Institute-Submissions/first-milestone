# Welcome to my first milestone project! 

This is my very first milestone project, named by BeneFTIness and is a Gym Website, 
this was inspiered by the fact that I believe gym and sports are lifestyle.

Thinking of that, I created a website that is a user friendly easy to access and have added a component to inspire beginners'
to get healthier and fitness.
 
 
# UX 

The UX of the site is designed to be easy to access. The site is static in line with what has been taught so far in this part of the course, HTML5 and CSS3. The idea is a user can be motivated/inspiered by the images and videos in the site which appear first followed by the offer of services of the best professional available for a reasonable monthly fee. .

The UI colors I have chosen are a light green and grey for Logo, yellow and light grey and whites for the background off whites, I feel this pallette of colours gave a clean look to the site.

The site is made easy to navigate, the bar navigation menu shows the relevant information and services available in the gym, this feature can be seen in the mobile and tablet where all links are funcioning.

This project used HTML5 to implement semantic web design markup.

  * I have used CSS3 for styling the site and because of CSS3 features like flexbox and grid.
